										p "I couldn’t be more pleased with how the Vaan Group created our website. 100% of our sales come from the web so it’s critical that our site be unique, simple to navigate / use and most importantly be beautifully crafted. The Vaan group led by Xavier and Chuong accomplished this with flying colors."

They brought so much passion and excitement to the table - always inspiring us to take smart risks and aim higher. They graciously shared their connections with us and secured several keynote speakers, sponsorship partnerships and influential attendees. X and Chuong really care about the projects they work on and we feel so fortunate to have had them involved in establishing the Offsite brand."

										p "I sat down with Chuong and Xavier, founders of the The Vaan Group to initially discuss start-up culture and funding and I ended up walking away from that meeting with a new design agency. I fell in love with their passion, enthusiasm and we connected on so many different levels. From the very beginning they understood my vision and they were able to translate everything into a beautifully designed and user-friendly app. Their communication and dedication to my project was everything I needed in an agency and I could not imagine my business without them."

										p "Without our collaboration with the Vaan Group, Offsite wouldn't be where it is today. They were an invaluable resource in getting this idea off the ground, leveraging their expertise in design along with an intuitive understanding of brand values. We're so lucky to have worked with them and look forward continuing the relationship in the future! "
